## FAQ
> Hirsh is unable to add some roles?

You would face this problem if the role Hirsh is trying to give is above its own in the role hierarchy. To fix this, either push Hirsh up the hierarchy enough that it can award that role or add the problematic role to the list of ignored roles in the config file under the Roles section.
